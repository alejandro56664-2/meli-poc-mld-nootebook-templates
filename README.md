# meli-poc-mld-nootebook-templates

This PoC seeks to evaluate the feasibility of using some scaffolding tool for the notebooks used within the team to speed up iteration on data-driven solution proposals. In this way, by following a predefined guide on the steps that these iterations are expected to contain, team members are enabled to focus on delivering value to the business.
